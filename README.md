# pivotal-api-test1

WHAT IS IT?
------------

Pivotal api project has as objective to automate acceptance test cases for Pivotal tracker
endpoints (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5#Endpoints) by using java and Cucumber technology.
Pivotal Tracker is a straightforward project-planning tool that helps software development teams form
realistic expectations about when work might be completed based on the teamâ€™s ongoing performance.
Pivotal Tracker provides an API that can be used to create, retrieve, update, and delete virtually all
of the resources stored and manipulated by the system.

FEATURES TESTED
---------------

The following features are the main that are implemented in this framework.

   Acceptance tests.

   - Project
   - Story
   - Comment

REQUIREMENTS AND SET CONFIGURATIONS
-----------------------------------

To set the configuration of this framework is required the following:

   - IntelliJ idea IDE.
   - Download Gradle 3.0 or superior: https://gradle.org/gradle-download/
   - Clone/download the project from GitHub repository: https://github.com/AT-01/pivotal-api-test1.git

Once those requirements are done, follow these steps:

   - Open the project downloaded with the IntelliJ IDE.
   - Open the Gradle properties file e.g. gradle.properties file.
   - Set the required parameters:
       * proxy = Is the proxy configuration.
       * token = Is the token generated by pivotal tracker.
       * featureFolders = name of folders to be executed (e.g. projects, comment, story)
       * cucumberOptions = Tags names used in the step definitions (e.g. @acceptance).
       
       You can use tags names in each scenario or feature for example:

        ```
        @acceptance
        Scenario: GET method for Story API
          When ...
          .
          .

        ```

COMMAND LINE EXECUTION
-----------------------
   - To check the quality in the project's Java source files the framework are applying the Checkstyle plugin.
   The plugin adds a number of tasks to the project that perform the quality checks. You can execute the checks
   by running:

   ```
   gradle check
   ```

   - To execute gradle tasks configured into build.gradle file, you can use the following instruction:
   use proxy param if it is necessary.

   ```
    gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -Pproxy=PROXY
   ```

   - To execute steps definitions by folder, you can use the following command line:

   ```
    gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PfeatureFolders=project
   ```

   If you want to execute more than one folder then split them by a comma see the example:

   ```
   gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PfeatureFolders=project,story
   ```

   - To execute test scenarios by tag names, you can use the following command line:

   ```
   gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PcucumberOptions="--tags @acceptance"
   ```

   If you want to execute more than one tag then split them by a comma see the example:

   ```
   gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PcucumberOptions="--tags @acceptance,@smoke"
   ```
