# pivotal-api-test1

WHAT IS IT?
------------

Pivotal api project has as objective to automate acceptance test cases for Pivotal tracker
endpoints (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api/rest/v5#Endpoints) by using java and Cucumber technology.
Pivotal Tracker is a straightforward project-planning tool that helps software development teams form
realistic expectations about when work might be completed based on the team’s ongoing performance.
Pivotal Tracker provides an API that can be used to create, retrieve, update, and delete virtually all
of the resources stored and manipulated by the system.

FEATURES TESTED
---------------

The following features are the main that are implemented in this framework.

   Acceptance tests.

   - Project
   - Story
   - Comment

REQUIREMENTS AND SET CONFIGURATIONS
-----------------------------------

To set the configuration of this framework is required the following:

   - IntelliJ idea IDE.
   - Download Gradle 3.0 or superior: https://gradle.org/gradle-download/
   - Clone/download the project from GitHub repository: https://github.com/AT-01/pivotal-api-test1.git

Once those requirements are done, follow these steps:

   - Open the project downloaded with the IntelliJ IDE.
   - Open the Gradle properties file e.g. gradle.properties file.
   - Set the required parameters:
       * proxy = Is the proxy configuration.
       * token = Is the token generated by pivotal tracker.
       * featureFolders = name of folders to be executed (e.g. projects, comment, story)
       * cucumberOptions = Tags names used in the step definitions (e.g. @Acceptance)
   - After configuring those params the framework should be executed.

COMMAND LINE EXECUTION
-----------------------
   - To check the quality in the project's Java source files the framework are applying the Checkstyle plugin.
   The plugin adds a number of tasks to the project that perform the quality checks. You can execute the checks
   by running:
       ```
       gradle check
       ```
   - To execute gradle tasks configured into build.gradle file, you can use the following instruction:
   use proxy param if it is necessary.
       ```
       gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -Pproxy=PROXY
       ```
   - To execute steps definitions by folder, you can use the following command line:
       ```
       gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PfeatureFolders=project
       ```
    If you want to execute more than one folder then split them by a comma see the example:
        ```
        gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PfeatureFolders=project,story
        ```
   - To execute test scenarios by tag names, you can use the following command line:
        ```
        gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PcucumberOptions="--tags @acceptance"
        ```
    If you want to execute more than one tag then split them by a comma see the example:
        ```
        gradle executeFeatures -Ptoken=TOKEN -PcucumberOptions="--tags @acceptance,@smoke"
        ```
